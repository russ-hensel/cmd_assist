help for misc commands  


Status: just a few commands but seem to work 

 

------------------- Briefly ------------------- 

Commands for several different purposes, as a whole not for any single purpose :

  
	    pwd # the current working directory is displayed with this command.
	    man # Display manual ( in arg 2 )
                   + an argument, the command name, whose manual youwant 


    ===========================not yet, ever ? ... right now for one arg or no arg commands 

    >> cat – you can view and add to a text file with this command.
    >> cd – change to your home directory with this command. appending a space and a name will switch you to the named directory. appending two periods will bring you to the current directory’s parent directory.
    >> du – this command displays disk space usage of files in a directory.
    >> chmod – this command is used to change the read, write and execute file permissions.
    >> history – using this command you can see a list of the recently executed commands entered through the command line.
    >> locate – find a file’s location by name with this command.
    >> more – this is a very helpful command that displays multiple pages of information one screen at a time. hitting enter will show you the next screen.
    >> man – short for manual, this command displays the reference manual pages for a specified command. entering man ls will show what the manual has on the ls command.
    >> passwd – this command allows you to create or update passwords for user accounts.
    >> pwd # the current working directory is displayed with this command.
    >> mkdir – you can create a new directory with this command as long as none already exist with the selected name.
    >> mv – rename or move files and directories with this command.
    >> sudo – this is a very powerful command that allows an authorized user to execute commands as the root user of the system.
    >> touch – you can create a file that does not already exist with this command. if the file exists, the timestamp is updated, but the contents remain unchanged.
