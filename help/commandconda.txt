!! missing conda install
!! missing set py env 

commandconda.txt

conda updates installs python modules and manages environments



Base command is for conda

Argument_1 ( editable drop down ) is for conda options like install...

Argument_2 ( editable dropdown, dropdown has examples ) is to specify the module/environment .... 


think it used to work but not now conda not found for some reason
         terminal not initialized
         works manually in terminal later
    what it says
    no sudo !!

    You need to run those commands on a console
         with administrative rights, in windows,
         or with a sudo before them on linux.

    I tend to run these three lines in order every time I need to update:

    conda update conda -y
    conda update --all -y
    conda update qt pyqt spyder -y

    Updating Spyder

    If you installed Spyder through Anaconda (recommended),
    WinPython, MacPorts, or your system package manager,
    update using those same methods. With Anaconda,
    just run (in Anaconda Prompt if on Windows,
              otherwise in your system terminal):

    conda update anaconda
    conda update spyder
    conda -V # conda version
    update install
        >> conda update conda # to update conda and other stuff

    Environments

    Create a virtual environment for your project

        In the terminal client enter the following where yourenvname is the name you want to call your environment, and replace x.x with the Python version you wish to use. (To see a list of available python versions first, type conda search "^python$" and press enter.)

    conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x anaconda

    * >> conda remove -n yourenvname -all   # delete env = yourenvname

    >> conda info --envs # list environments, * for current
    >> conda activate environment_name
    >> conda remove -n environment_name -all # delete env = environment_name
