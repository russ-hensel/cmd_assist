#!/bin/bash

# My first script

echo "Hello World! again"


#[me@linuxbox me]$ chmod 755 hello_world

#The "755" will give us read, write, and execute permission. 
#Everybody else will get only read and execute permission. 
#To make the script private, (i.e., only we can read and execute), use "700" instead.
 

# At this point, our script will run. Try this:
# [me@linuxbox me]$ ./hello_world

# For executing the script type bash filename.sh  bash ex_popen.sh

ls ex_x*.*
